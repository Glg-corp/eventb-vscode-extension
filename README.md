Hello UNamur students!

## Installation

1. In Rodin, install the "Camille text editor" plug-in.
2. Install this extension

## Usage

1. You can create and edit `.bc` (context) and `.bm` (machine) files in Visual Studio with this extension.
2. When you feel like testing your code, copy/paste it in the *Camille* editor of Rodin and hit CTRL+S
3. You can now use Rodin to test your code

## Symbols

As you know, Event-B uses a lot of unicode symbols. You can create them in VSCode with IntelliSense, using the corresponding keyword of the symbol you want.

The keyword of a symbol is often its English name (ex: *for all*), its most common associated keyword (ex: *in*) or its name in Rodin (ex: *Partial injection*?!).

## Upcoming features

- More accurate autocompletion
- Commands to create files
